# Python Environment Setup & First Script

## Task Overview
This task focuses on setting up the Python development environment and writing the first Python script as part of the internship program.

## Tools Used
- Python (Official CPython)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Python Extension for VS Code
- Windows Terminal / VS Code Terminal

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Python from the official Python website and verified installation using the command line.
2. Installed Visual Studio Code and added the Python extension.
3. Created a new project folder and opened it in VS Code.
4. Created a Python file named `hello_world.py`.
5. Wrote a Python program to display intern details such as name, role, and date.
6. Used variables to store values instead of hardcoding.
7. Executed the Python script using the terminal.
8. Modified the script to accept user input using the `input()` function.
9. Added comments to explain each line of code for better readability.

## Files Included
- `hello_world.py` – Python script demonstrating variables, input/output, and execution
- `screenshots/` – Screenshots showing terminal execution and output (if included)

## Learning Outcome
Through this task, I learned how to:
- Install and verify Python
- Use VS Code as a Python IDE
- Create and run Python scripts
- Work with variables and user input
- Use terminal for program execution

This task helped me understand the basics of Python programming and development environment setup.
